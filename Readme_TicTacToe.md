# Tic-Tac-Toe (Player vs CPU)

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python, where a player competes against the CPU. The game uses a 3x3 board represented as a dictionary of rows, allowing players to input their desired row (`row1`, `row2`, `row3`) and position (`0`, `1`, `2`).

## Features

- User selects either 'X' or 'O' as their symbol.
- The game validates player input to prevent invalid row/column selections.
- CPU randomly selects a valid empty position for its move.
- Board updates and displays after each round.
- Win conditions are checked after every turn, including rows, columns, and diagonals.
- Game stops once either player wins.

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Choose your symbol (`X` or `O`).
3. Enter your move's row and column index.
4. Watch the board update after each move.
5. Game continues until a winner is determined.

This is a beginner-friendly project to understand input validation, dictionaries, loops, and basic game logic in Python.
